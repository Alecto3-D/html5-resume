PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE
Photon Research Associates, Jan. 1996 - Present
Senior Staff Scientist core responsibilities: Algorithm and software development, implementation and testing. Activities include:
Design and implementation of real time PDB search tool to identify structures similar to specified structures (Kinase)
Design of real time hyperspectral anomaly detection algorithms as well as temperature feature extraction for new LWIR sensor in C++ using Visual .NET and delivered to customer on Linux platform
Implemented and demonstrated Spectral Matched Filter (SMF) algorithm for target detection in a complex target/background scene
Implemented Atmospheric Correction algorithms in C++ and processed AVIRIS data
Developed algorithms for the IR Sensor Study - Algorithm Development Program that demonstrated advanced detection and identification techniques against measured CBD & CBE data sets
Participated in development of Cirrus cloud detection and characterization for HYMSMO program
Developed a mid-course discrimination simulation for SBIRS-Low and performance simulation in order to evaluate the effectiveness of acquisition, tracking, and discrimination in chaff environments
Developed and simulated mid course discrimination algorithms for the Navy Theater Wide COEA (Navy Theater Ballistic Missile Defense)
Developed Monte Carlo simulations of IR sensor(s) and target scenarios over variations in launch, sensor and solar geometry
Simulated SBIRS-High, SBIRS-Low and a number of novel staring/scanning sensor designs and demonstrated performance against Technical Intelligence targets, developed code for integrating targets into backgrounds, incorporated a matched filter into high fidelity simulation and control logic for executables that provide parallel processing
